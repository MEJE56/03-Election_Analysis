## Conclusions Proposal
The project enable the team get familiar with the data of the election result for Colorado state, while developing the team was able to develop a standard code *called PyPoll* to read and analyse the data. 
PyPoll can be easily reused make broader analysis. The set of data elections_reulst.csv contained 3 candidates, 3 counties and 369,711 register (votes), this items can be extrapolated to more counties (the whole estate), more candidates, and why not take care of a Presidetial election. Even more data can be analyze, such us race and ethnicity could be incorporated to the statistics of the election.
